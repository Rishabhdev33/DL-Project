# Handwritten Equation Solver
In this project, we explore the development and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the task of image classification. CNNs are a class of deep learning models that have proven remarkably effective in recognizing patterns within image data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks such as handwritten digit recognition, facial detection, and general object classification.
The goal of this mini project is to design a CNN that can take in grayscale images of size 32x32 pixels and accurately classify them into one of 14 possible categories.
